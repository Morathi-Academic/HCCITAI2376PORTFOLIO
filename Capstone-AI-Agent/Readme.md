📘 Project Overview

This folder contains the complete proposal and design documentation for the Eagles Study Companion, an AI-powered hybrid learning system created for the ITAI Capstone Project.

The system combines a Research Assistant Agent and an Interactive Learning Companion to solve real problems students face when studying independently. It includes detailed architecture, agent descriptions, tool integration plans, and a structured development roadmap.

🧠 What This Project Addresses

Students often struggle with:

Finding reliable, organized learning resources

Receiving personalized, adaptive explanations

Using static study tools that cannot assess progress or adjust difficulty

The Eagles Study Companion solves this by integrating:

Intelligent research support

Adaptive tutoring

Personalized quiz generation

User progress tracking

This project aligns with course requirements while delivering a real, practical educational solution.


The main document detailing:
